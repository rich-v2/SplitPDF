# SplitPDF
Simple Python Tool to split pdf files.

Just put a PDF file in the same directory and run the SplitPDF.py

Note: In order to run the .py file, you need to install PyPDF2 on your machine.

I have also created an EXE file using pyinstaller, however, this one might trigger your Antivirus Software.
As far as I'm aware, files created by pyinstaller are safe.

Note: The EXE, while functional, is outdated. I will not update this anytime soon -- I recommend using the .py files, as they are up to date.
